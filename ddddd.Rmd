## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(lm(data=clean, clean$NIVEASales~clean$NIVEAPrice*clean$Nivea_Above+clean$NIVEAPriceDummy+clean$DOVEPrice*clean$Dove_Above+clean$DOVESales+clean$REXONAPrice*clean$Rexona_Above+clean$REXONASales+clean$WEEK.x*clean$Temperature+clean$WEEK.x*yq+clean$`NIVEAD+F.x`+clean$`DOVED+F.x`+clean$`REXONAD+F.x`+seq(1:124)+clean$PriceWar))    

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
